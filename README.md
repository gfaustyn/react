# react

This is a simple React app that allows you to first search for animal shelters by zipcode. 
Clicking on a shelter triggers a list of animals available in that shelter by the shelter's ID. 
Then you can click on a specific pet by ID and get a description of the animal, what it needs, does it have shots?, how old the animal is etc.

To work this project first clone the repo Run NPM install Then run NPM start

*** please note - the easiest way to run this app is in Google Chrome, and it requires a CORS plugin that can be located here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en **
